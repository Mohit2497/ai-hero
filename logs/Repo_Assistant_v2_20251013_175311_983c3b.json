Uncertainty is a key element of agent design.\n  - Trust and transparency are foundational layers of Agent design.\n  - Humans are in control of when the Agent is on/off and Agent status is clearly visible at all times.\n\n## The Guidelines to Implement These Principles\n\nWhen you\u2019re using the previous design principles, use the following guidelines:\n\n1. **Transparency**: Inform the user that AI is involved, how it functions (including past actions), and how to give feedback and modify the system.\n2. **Control**: Enable the user to customize, specify preferences and personalize, and have control over the system and its attributes (including the ability to forget).\n3. **Consistency**: Aim for consistent, multi-modal experiences across devices and endpoints. Use familiar UI/UX elements where possible (e.g., microphone icon for voice interaction) and reduce the customer\u2019s cognitive load as much as possible (e.g., aim for concise responses, visual aids, and \u2018Learn More\u2019 content).\n\n## How To Design a Travel Agent using These Principles and Guidelines\n\nImagine you are designing a Travel Agent, here is how you could think about using the Design Principles and Guidelines:\n\n1. **Transparency** \u2013 Let the user know that the Travel Agent is an AI-enabled Agent. Provide some basic instructions on how to get started (e.g., a \u201cHello\u201d message, sample prompts). Clearly document this on the product page. Show the list of prompts a user has asked in the past. Make it clear how to give feedback (thumbs up and down, Send Feedback button, etc.). Clearly articulate if the Agent has usage or topic restrictions.\n2. **Control** \u2013 Make sure it\u2019s clear how the user can modify the Agent after it\u2019s been created wit",

These principles offer a starting point for defining and building agent experiences rather than a prescriptive architecture [03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Agentic-Framework/blob/main/03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md).\n\nIn general, agents should:\n*   Broaden and scale human capacities (e.g., brainstorming, problem-solving, automation).\n*   Fill in knowledge gaps (e.g., provide information on knowledge domains, translation).\n*   Facilitate and support collaboration.\n*   Make us better versions of ourselves (e.g., life coach, task master, helping learn emotional regulation and mindfulness skills, building resilience) [03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Agentic-Framework/blob/main/03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md).\n\nThe Agentic Design Principles are categorized as follows:\n\n### Agent (Space)\nThese principles relate to the environment in which the agent operates and how agents are designed for engaging in physical and digital worlds:\n*   **Connecting, not collapsing**: Agents should help connect people to other people, events, and actionable knowledge to enable collaboration and connection. They are not designed to replace or belittle people.\n*   **Easily accessible yet occasionally invisible**: Agents largely operate in the background, nudging users only when relevant. They should be easily discoverable and accessible on any device or platform, support multimodal inputs and outputs, and seamlessly transition between foreground and background, proactive and reactive states. Even in invisible form, their processes and collaboration with other agents should be transparent and controllable by the user [03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Agentic-Framework/blob/main/03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md).\n\n### Agent (Time)\nThese principles concern how the agent operates over time and interacts across the past, present, and future:\n*   **Continuously learning but respectfully forgetting**: Agents continuously learn from user interactions and external data, adapting to user needs and preferences over time. They should respect user privacy by managing data based on user intent and preferences.\n*   **Proactive anticipation but always optional**: Agents anticipate user needs and proactively offer relevant assistance, but users should always have control to accept, reject, or ignore suggestions.\n*   **Contextually aware but always controllable**: Agents are aware of the user's current context (time, location, activity) to provide relevant support, and their operation should always be controllable by the user, including the ability to turn them on/off, modify settings, or clear memory [03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Agentic-Framework/blob/main/03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md).\n\n### Agent (Core)\nThese are the key elements in the core of an agent\u2019s design:\n*   **Embrace uncertainty but establish trust**: A certain level of agent uncertainty is expected and is a key element of agent design. Trust and transparency are foundational layers, with humans in control of the agent's on/off status, which should be clearly visible at all times [03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Agentic-Framework/blob/main/03-agentic-design-patterns/README.md).\n\n### Guidelines for Implementation\nWhen implementing these design principles, the following guidelines should be used:\n1.  **Transparency**: Inform the user that AI is involved, how it functions (including past actions), and how to give feedback and modify the system.\n2.  **Control**: Enable the user to customize, specify preferences, personalize, and have control over the system and its attributes (including the ability to forget).\n3.  **Consistency**: Aim for consistent, multi-modal experiences across devices and endpoints.
